# ESTCube-2 Telemetry Forwarding Client

The ESTCube-2 telemetry forwarding client (_decoder and relay_) is open-source software.
It enables radio amateurs from around the world to downlink telemetry data and view them on a dashboard locally.

When allowed, it relays the received packets to ESTCube Mission Control in Tartu, Estonia.
This allows the ESTCube team to receive telemetry data, even when the satellite isn't accessible over Estonia.
This is vital as the fly-over times of the satellite are relatively brief.

This is a cross-platform console application that interfaces with a [TNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller) and serves a dashboard front-end for browsers.
